                    As a child, I lived in my imagination. I fantasized about the world in rain puddles and the one I
                    saw in the reflection of my bedroom mirror. As I grew up, I came to explore my feelings about what I
                    saw and imagined by painting.”

                    <p>
                        It often happens that when a person views a work of art they feel perplexed, asking themselves,
                        “What does it mean? What did the artist intend?” and finally shrugging their shoulders and
                        walking away they exclaim, “I don’t get it!” But, are these the right questions to ask, or are
                        there others that might be more useful. What about asking such questions as, “How does this
                        piece make me feel?” or “What do you think the artist was feeling when she/he/they chose those
                        colors?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The meaning of a piece of art is often complex and personal, personal to both the artist and the
                        viewer. What a viewer sees is dependent not only on what the artist intends for him to see (for
                        instance, what is represented, the colors that are used, the artist’s design, etc.), but what
                        the artist unconsciously communicates in their piece. In addition, the viewer’s temperament and
                        experiences in the world and with other artworks become part of the meaning of the work. To
                        quote a poet, Edward Hirsch, “The reader completes the poem, in the process bringing to it his
                        or her own past experiences.” 1

                        Art represents different things to different people and can be interpreted in a variety of ways.
                        In some cases, art can communicate a message, evoke an emotion, or tell a story, while in others
                        it may simply be an aesthetically pleasing design. No matter the intention of the artist, art
                        has the potential to take on different meanings for different viewers. This is why many people
                        find art so captivating. It can be a powerful tool for communicating ideas and feelings, as well
                        as providing a unique outlet for expressing one’s creativity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At last, when interpreting a piece of art, it is important to consider the context in which it
                        was created. To gain a greater understanding of an artwork, it is often important to learn more
                        about the event(s) that inspired it—think of “Guernica” by Picasso. Additionally, the colors,
                        shapes, and lines used may be symbolic, e.g., red can mean passion, love, anger or purple can
                        denote royalty and luxury.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Guernica,” painted in response to the German bombing of the Spanish city of Guernica in 1937,
                        is rendered in shades of gray. No color is used. It’s one of the most powerful anti-war
                        paintings in the history of art. It’s important to pay attention to these elements as well as
                        the items included in representational works. There is an area of study in art called
                        iconography, which is a system of images in artworks that convey particular meanings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you can see, the meaning of a piece of art is subjective and open to infinite
                        interpretations. And it’s always a conversation between you and the artist and the rest of the
                        world. The meaning of the message is all of us.
